Deprication of DNS64 for Discovery of IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address
                               Synthesis
                  draft-buraglio-deprecate7050-latest

Abstract

   [RFC7050] describes a method for detecting the presence of DNS64 and
   for learning the IPv6 prefix used for protocol translation on an
   access network.  This methodology depends on the existence of a well-
   known IPv4-only fully qualified domain name "ipv4only.arpa.".
   Because newer methods exist that lack the requirement of a higher
   level protocol, instead using existing operations in the form of
   native router advertisements, discovery of the IPv6 prefix used for
   protocol translation is deprecated to legacy status.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8781] describes a Neighbor Discovery option to be used in Router
   Advertisements (RAs) to communicate prefixes of Network Address and
   Protocol Translation from IPv6 clients to IPv4 servers (NAT64) to
   hosts.
